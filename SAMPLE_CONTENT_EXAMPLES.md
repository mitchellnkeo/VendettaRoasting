# The Art of Pour-Over Coffee

Pour-over coffee brewing is one of the most rewarding ways to make coffee at home. It gives you 
complete control over every aspect of the brewing process, allowing you to extract the perfect 
flavors from your beans.

## What You'll Need

- Freshly roasted coffee beans
- Pour-over dripper (Hario V60, Chemex, or Kalita Wave)
- Paper filter
- Gooseneck kettle
- Scale (for precise measurements)
- Timer

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Measure Your Coffee

For a single cup, use 20-25 grams of coffee beans. Grind them to a medium-fine consistency, 
similar to sea salt.

### Step 2: Heat Your Water

Heat filtered water to 195-205°F (90-96°C). The exact temperature depends on your coffee's 
roast level - lighter roasts prefer higher temperatures.

### Step 3: Rinse the Filter

Place the filter in your dripper and rinse it with hot water. This removes any paper taste 
and preheats your brewing vessel.

### Step 4: Bloom

Add just enough water to saturate the coffee grounds (about twice the weight of your coffee). 
Let it bloom for 30 seconds. This allows the coffee to release carbon dioxide and prepare 
for extraction.

### Step 5: Pour in Circles

Slowly pour the remaining water in a circular motion, starting from the center and moving 
outward. Keep the water level consistent and avoid pouring directly on the filter.

### Step 6: Enjoy!

Your pour-over should be ready in 2-3 minutes. Pour into your favorite mug and enjoy the 
fruits of your labor!

## Pro Tips

- Use a scale to ensure consistency
- Keep your pour steady and controlled
- Experiment with grind size to find your perfect cup
- Clean your equipment after each use

Happy brewing!

**Our Story:**
```
Vendetta Roasting was born in a small garage in Seattle, where we experimented with 
different roasting techniques to bring out the unique characteristics of each bean.

What started as a weekend hobby quickly became a passion. We began sourcing beans directly 
from farmers, learning about their stories and the care they put into growing exceptional coffee.

Today, we're proud to work with farmers across Central America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, 
paying fair prices and supporting sustainable farming practices. Every batch we roast is 
crafted with the same attention to detail and respect for the bean that we had in that 
first garage.
```

make it possible. We believe great coffee should be accessible, sustainable, and delicious.
```

**Our Values:**
- Quality: We never compromise on the quality of our beans or our roasting process
